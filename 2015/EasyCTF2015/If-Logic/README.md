Description: Solved by 327 teams.
Use the programming interface to complete this task. You'll be given a list of numbers.

Input: A list of numbers, separated by commas.
Output: Print `hi` if the number is 0-50 (inclusive), `hey` if the number is 51-100 (inclusive), and `hello` if anything else. Each greeting should have a linebreak after it.

Read the input from a file called `if-logic.in` that's in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called `if-logic.out`. 

Like other programming challenges, this challenge had to be solved using [programming interface](https://www.easyctf.com/programming). Solving this challenge requires basic knowledge of Python.
A simple Python script called [iflogic.py](./iflogic.py) was written to solve the challenge.

Upon successful run, it gave us the flag which was:
`easyctf{is_it_hi_or_hey_or_something_else}`

This challenge was a simple cryptography challenge. The encryption used a simple cipher encryption known as the Caesar Cipher. The key for the cipher used is 7. I generated a one-liner in Ruby to solve this challenge for me. The encrypted text (can be found in enc.txt) and is:
`Cnebnl Vtxltk bl max uxlm unm fr ykbxgw ebdxl Gtihexhg uxmmxk yhk patmxoxk kxtlhg. Ha pxee. Max yetz bl xtlrvmy{Gti0exhg_ol_Vt3l4k}`

The output of the deciphered text (can be found in plain.txt) was:
Julius Caesar is the best but my friend likes Napoleon better for whatever reason. Oh well. The flag is `easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}`

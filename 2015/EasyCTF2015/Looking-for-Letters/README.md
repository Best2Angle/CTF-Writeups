Like other programming challenges, this challenge had to be solved using [programming interface](https://www.easyctf.com/programming). Solving this challenge requires basic knowledge of Python.
A simple Python script called [nonumbers.py](./nonumbers.py) was written to solve the challenge.

Upon successful run, it gave us the flag which was:
`easyctf{filtering_the_#s_out}`

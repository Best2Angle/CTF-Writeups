Description: Solved by 504 teams.
Use the programming interface to complete this task. You'll be given a math expression, such as `add 1 2` or `subtract 5 3`, where you will perform the operations `1+2` and `5-3`, respectively.

ID: `math-class`
Input: An expression in the form of `operation operand1 operand2`, separated by spaces. Read input from `math-class.in`.
Output: The absolute value of the evaluated expression. Your output should always be a positive integer.

There are only 2 different possible operations, addition and subtraction, and all operands will be integer values between 1 and 1000. As always, remember to end your program with a newline.

Like other programming challenges, this challenge had to be solved using [programming interface](https://www.easyctf.com/programming). Solving this challenge requires basic knowledge of Python.
A simple Python script called [mathclass.py](./mathclass.py) was written to solve the challenge.

Upon successful run, it gave us the flag which was:
`easyctf{have_y0u_had_enough_of_math_in_sk0ol_yet}`

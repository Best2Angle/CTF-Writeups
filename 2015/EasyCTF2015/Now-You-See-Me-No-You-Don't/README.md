Description:
```
Now you see me, now you don't? There's a file in /problems/elusive, but I can't seem to find it. Find it and print its contents!
```
Hint:
```
What are hidden files in Linux?
```
Linux consideres files to be hidden when their name begins with a dot. To display all files including the hidden ones we can use ```ls -a```.
This reveals a file containing the flag named ```.hidden_file```.
The flag is: ```easyctf{just_playing_h1de_and_seek_lel}```

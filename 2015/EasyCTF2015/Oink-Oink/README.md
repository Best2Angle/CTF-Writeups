Use the programming interface to solve this problem.

Now that we know how to convert from English to Pig Latin, can we reverse the translation? Given a sentence in Pig Latin, reverse it and try to find the original English text.

Be careful to note that if a Pig Latin word is capitalized, like "Arispay", the original English word is "Paris" rather than "pAris". Case counts!

ID: `piglatin2`
Input: A sentence in Pig Latin.
Output: The translation in English.

Read the input from a file called `piglatin2.in` that's in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called `piglatin2.out`


Similar to other programming challenges, this had to be solved using [programming interface](https://www.easyctf.com/programming). A Python script named [oinkoink.py](./oinkoink.py) was written for the purpose.
Upon successful run, we get our flag which was `easyctf{th0se_pesky_capit4ls_were_a_pa1n,_weren't_they?}`

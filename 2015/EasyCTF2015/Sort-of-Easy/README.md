Description: Solved by 325 teams.
Use the programming interface to complete this task.

Input: A list of numbers, separated by commas. Ex: `3,28,9,17,5`
Output: The list sorted from largest to smallest, separated by commas. Ex: `28,17,9,5,3`

Read the input from a file called `sorting-job.in` that's in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called `sorting-job.out`.

Like other programming challenges, this challenge had to be solved using [programming interface](https://www.easyctf.com/programming). Solving this challenge requires basic knowledge of Python.
A simple Python script called [sortof.py](./sortof.py) was written to solve the challenge.

Upon successful run, it gave us the flag which was:
`easyctf{sorting_is_as_easy_as_3_2_1!}`

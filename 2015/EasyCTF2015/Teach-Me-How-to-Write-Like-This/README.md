My friend Michelle found this cool new site, but you have to pay to read and she doesn't have money. Can you help her read the [fics](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/fandoms/browse.html) anyways?

This challenge is really easy. All we have to do is open the link and view the source of the web page.
Under the `div` with class `fanfic` we can see the text that was blurred out. Searching through the text, we can find our flag which is: `easyctf{geico_geck0s}`

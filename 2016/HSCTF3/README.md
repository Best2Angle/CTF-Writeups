# HSCTF 3

HSCTF ("High School Capture the Flag") is the first CTF designed by high schoolers for high schoolers.

Unlike other CTFs, HSCTF isn't purely about computer security. It extends the CTF model of competition to other areas of computer science such as the design and analysis of algorithms and programming languages. Each challenge will still have a flag, and most of our challenges will fall into the traditional CTF categories of cryptography, reverse engineering, programming languages, forensics, and recon.


## HTS end result:
###14th place (unranked)

# The Cube
> Description: I really like Rubik's Cubes, so I created a challenge for you. I put the flag on the white tiles and scrambled the cube. Once you solved the cube, you'll know my secret.

> Attachment: README.txt

# Solution
`README.txt` contains a scramble encoded in [Rubik's Cube notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation). The easiest way to do this challenge is to perform the scramble, mark the sides of the cube with the correct letters (as shown in `README.txt`) and the reverse then scramble (or solve the cube for good practice). After solving flag will be visible on the white side.

The flag is `IW{3DRC3}`.

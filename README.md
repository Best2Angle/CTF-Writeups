## CTFs We Participated In

**ALL OF THEM.**

## Licences

We use a combination of the [Beerware](https://tldrlegal.com/license/beerware-license), [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org), and [WTF](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying) licenses. Which license applies to what file, we'll let you figure out. ;)
